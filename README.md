# Final Project for 2020 Georgia Tech Data Analytics Bootcamp

Have you ever watched a movie and ended up disappointed with the outcome? Our project focused on designing models to predict IMDB movie ratings based on genre, year of release, budget, duration, and director.

## Objective

For this project, we used various models to determine the best method for predicting the IMDB rating of a movie based on historical data. In order to conduct this predictive modeling endeavor, we sourced our data from [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/stefanoleone992/imdb-extensive-dataset/) which featured a set of csv files with information regarding movies rated by IMDB users dating back from 1906 to 2019.
